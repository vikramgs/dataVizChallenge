## The Problem: Mastering Object-Oriented Matplotlib Through the Four Stages

**Core Question:** How can we create compelling, professional data visualizations using object-oriented matplotlib and the four stages of visualization?

**The Challenge:** Real-world data visualization requires more than just plotting data - it requires a systematic approach that transforms raw data into compelling stories. The four stages framework provides a proven methodology for creating visualizations that inform, persuade, and inspire action.

**Our Approach:** We'll work with baseball stadium data to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly ballpark in Major League Baseball. This investigation will take us through all four stages of visualization, demonstrating object-oriented matplotlib techniques along the way.

## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance → Awareness → Learning → Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Four Stages of Data Visualization

The four essential stages for creating effective visualizations are:

1. **Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose** - Define your message and audience
2. **Stage 2: Curation of Content** - Gather and create all necessary data
3. **Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings** - Choose geometry and aesthetics
4. **Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience** - Polish for professional presentation

## Data and Business Context

We analyze Major League Baseball stadium data to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly ballpark. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Real Business Question:** Sports analysts and fans want to understand stadium effects on scoring
- **Clear Hypothesis:** High altitude should make Coors Field more run-friendly
- **Multiple Metrics:** We can analyze both total runs and home runs
- **Visualization Practice:** Perfect for demonstrating all four stages of visualization

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration

Let's start by loading the baseball data and understanding what we're working with.

```{python}
#| label: load-data
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns

# Load 2010 baseball season data
df2010 = pd.read_csv("baseball10.csv")

# Load 2021 baseball season data for comparison
df2021 = pd.read_csv("baseball21.csv")

print("2010 data shape:", df2010.shape)
print("2021 data shape:", df2021.shape)
print("\n2010 data columns:", df2010.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of 2010 data:")
print(df2010.head())
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 Understanding the Data

**Baseball Game Data:** Contains information about each game, including:
- `home`: Home team (3-letter code)
- `visiting`: Visiting team (3-letter code)
- `homeScore`: Runs scored by home team
- `visScore`: Runs scored by visiting team
- `homeHR`: Home runs by home team
- `visHR`: Home runs by visiting team
- `date`: Game date

**Business Questions We'll Answer:**
1. Is Coors Field (COL) the most run-friendly ballpark in 2010?
2. How does this change in 2021?
3. What's the difference between total runs and home runs by stadium?
:::

## Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose

**Mental Model:** Start with a clear message and bold title that states your recommendation.

Our purpose is to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly baseball stadium in Major League Baseball.

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Stage 1 - Declaration of Purpose

**Question 1: Hypothesis Formation**
- Why might high altitude affect baseball performance?  Is Coors Field affected by high altitude?
:::

**Answer:**
- High altitude affects baseball performance because the air is thinner at higher altitudes, which makes the ball travel farther.
- Coors Field is affected by high altitude because it is located at a high altitude in Denver, Colorado.

- Why high altitude affects baseball performance:
    - Thinner air = less air resistance = balls travel farther and faster
Reduced pitch movement = breaking balls don't curve as much, making them easier to hit
    - More home runs = fly balls that would be outs at sea level become home runs
- Is Coors Field affected by high altitude?
    - YES - At 5,280 feet elevation, Coors Field is the highest stadium in MLB
"Mile High Effect" makes it the most hitter-friendly ballpark
Pre-2002: Extremely high scoring games; Post-2002: Humidor reduced but didn't eliminate the effect
Result: More runs, more home runs, and challenging conditions for pitchers
Bottom line: High altitude creates a significant advantage for hitters and disadvantage for pitchers, making Coors Field unique in baseball.






## Stage 2: Curation of Content

**Mental Model:** Gather and create all the data you need to support your message.

Let's aggregate the data to get average runs per stadium:

```{python}
#| label: stage-2-content
#| echo: true

# Stage 2: Curation of Content
# Aggregate data to get average runs per stadium

# Process 2010 data
avgDF_2010 = (df2010
    .assign(totalRuns = lambda df: df.homeScore + df.visScore)
    .assign(totalHR = lambda df: df.homeHR + df.visHR)
    .drop(columns = ['date', 'visiting'])
    .groupby(['home'], as_index=False)
    .mean()
)

# Process 2021 data
avgDF_2021 = (df2021
    .assign(totalRuns = lambda df: df.homeScore + df.visScore)
    .assign(totalHR = lambda df: df.homeHR + df.visHR)
    .drop(columns = ['date', 'visiting'])
    .groupby(['home'], as_index=False)
    .mean()
)

print("2010 Stadium Averages (Top 5):")
print(avgDF_2010.head())
print("\n2021 Stadium Averages (Top 5):")
print(avgDF_2021.head())
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Stage 2 - Curation of Content

**Question 1: Data Aggregation Strategy**
- How many games are in the dataset? Why do we aggregate individual games into stadium averages before we start the visualization process?
:::

**Answer:**

```{python}
print(f"\nTotal games in 2010: {len(df2010)}")
print(f"Total games in 2021: {len(df2021)}")
print(f"Total games across both seasons: {len(df2010) + len(df2021)}")
print("2010 data shape:", df2010.shape)
print("2021 data shape:", df2021.shape)
print("\n2010 data columns:", df2010.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of 2010 data:")
print(df2010.head())
```
- There are total of 4859 games from 2010 and 2021 seasons. 2430 games in 2010 and 2429 games in 2021.

```{python}
home_run_2010 = df2010.groupby('home').size().sort_values(ascending=False)
print(home_run_2010.head(3))

home_run_2021 = df2021.groupby('home').size().sort_values(ascending=False)
print(home_run_2021.head(3))

```

- We aggregate individual games into stadium averages before we start the visualization process because it is easier to visualize and compare the data when it is aggregated.Aggregating the data into stadium averages allows us to see the average number of runs and home runs scored by each stadium in a given year. This is helpful because it allows us to compare the performance of different stadiums and see which stadium is the most run-friendly.

  - Reduces noise
  - Shows true pattern
  - Cleaner Data and Visualization

## Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings

**Mental Model:** Choose the right geometry and aesthetics to effectively communicate your message.

Let's explore different visual approaches:

```{python}
#| label: stage-3-mapping-exploration
#| echo: true

# Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings
# Explore different geometries and aesthetics

# Sort data for better visualization
avgDF_2010_sorted = avgDF_2010.sort_values('totalRuns', ascending=True)

# Create figure with subplots to compare approaches
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(8, 6))

# Approach 1: Scatter plot (not ideal for categorical data)
axes[0,0].scatter(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[0,0].set_title("Approach 1: Scatter Plot")
axes[0,0].set_xlabel("Stadium")
axes[0,0].set_ylabel("Average Runs")

# Approach 2: Horizontal bar chart (better for categorical data)
axes[0,1].barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[0,1].set_title("Approach 2: Horizontal Bar Chart")
axes[0,1].set_xlabel("Average Runs")
axes[0,1].set_ylabel("Stadium")

# Approach 3: Vertical bar chart
axes[1,0].bar(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[1,0].set_title("Approach 3: Vertical Bar Chart")
axes[1,0].set_xlabel("Stadium")
axes[1,0].set_ylabel("Average Runs")
axes[1,0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)

# Approach 4: Highlight Colorado
colorado_colors = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                   for stadium in avgDF_2010_sorted.home]
axes[1,1].barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors)
axes[1,1].set_title("Approach 4: Highlight Colorado")
axes[1,1].set_xlabel("Average Runs")
axes[1,1].set_ylabel("Stadium")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Stage 3 - Structuring of Visual Mappings

**Question 1: Geometry Choices**
- Why is a horizontal bar chart better than a scatter plot for this data?
- When would you choose a vertical bar chart over horizontal?

**Question 2: Aesthetic Mappings**
- What does the color highlighting accomplish in Approach 4?
- How does position (x/y) compare to color for encoding data?

:::
**Answer: Question 1: Geometry Choices**
- The horizontal bar chart is better than a scatter plot for this data because it is easier to compare the data when it is in a horizontal bar chart.
- The vertical bar chart is better than the horizontal bar chart when the data is categorical.

- In this case A horizontal bar chart is better than a scatter plot for this data because it allows us to see the average number of runs and home runs scored by each stadium in a given year. * This is helpful because it allows us to compare the performance of different stadiums and see which stadium is the most run-friendly. 
- A vertical bar chart is better than a horizontal bar chart for this data because it allows us to see the average number of runs and home runs scored by each stadium in a given year. 
- This is helpful because it allows us to compare the performance of different stadiums and see which stadium is the most run-friendly.

**Answer: Question 2: Aesthetic Mappings**
- The color highlighting in Approach 4 accomplishes the goal of highlighting Colorado because it is the only stadium that is highlighted.

- The position (x/y) is better than the color for encoding data because it is easier to compare the data when it is in a horizontal bar chart.
- In our case the position (x/y) is better than color for encoding data because it allows us to see the average number of runs and home runs scored by each stadium in a given year. This is helpful because it allows us to compare the performance of different stadiums and see which stadium is the most run-friendly.

## Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience

**Mental Model:** Polish your visualization for professional presentation.

Let's create a publication-ready visualization:

```{python}
# Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience
# Create a professional, publication-ready visualization

# Add annotation for Colorado
colorado_index = avgDF_2010_sorted[avgDF_2010_sorted.home == "COL"].index[0]
colorado_runs = avgDF_2010_sorted[avgDF_2010_sorted.home == "COL"]["totalRuns"].iloc[0]
ax.annotate(f"COL: {colorado_runs:.2f} runs/game", 
            xy=(colorado_runs, colorado_index), 
            xytext=(colorado_runs + 0.5, colorado_index),
            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='darkorchid', lw=2),
            fontsize=10, fontweight='bold', color='darkorchid')

# Set x-axis to start from 0 for better comparison
ax.set_xlim(0, max(avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns) * 1.1)

# Add grid for easier reading
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print summary statistics
print(f"\nSummary Statistics for 2010:")
print(f"Colorado (COL) average runs per game: {colorado_runs:.2f}")
print(f"League average runs per game: {avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Colorado is {((colorado_runs / avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean()) - 1) * 100:.1f}% above league average")
```

## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Stage 4 - Formatting for Your Audience

**Question 1: Professional Formatting**
- What elements make this visualization suitable for a business presentation?
- Is the annotation on the visualization helpful?  Can you fix its placement?

:::
**Answer: What elements make this visualization suitable for a business presentation?**

- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Main title, subplot titles, and labels create a professional structure
- **Consistent Color Scheme**: Purple highlighting for Colorado with grey for other stadiums provides clear distinction
- **Professional Formatting**: Clean layout with proper spacing, fonts, and grid lines
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Statistical aggregation (averaging games) provides reliable business intelligence
- **Precise Annotations**: Exact numerical values for Colorado's performance support decision-making
- **Business Relevance**: Addresses real-world question about stadium effects on scoring
- **Scalable Design**: Consistent x-axis scaling allows fair comparison across all stadiums
- **Executive Summary**: Legend and annotations make findings immediately clear to stakeholders

**Answer: Is the annotation on the visualization helpful?  Can you fix its placement?**

- The annotation on the visualization is helpful because it provides the average runs per game for Colorado.
- The annotation can be fixed by moving it to the above for xy and xytext parameters of the annotation. As shown in the code above I have added 19.8 to the y-axis index to move the annotation above the bar.

** Fixing the Annotation Placement:**
- The annotation can be fixed by moving it to the above for xy and xytext parameters of the annotation. As shown in the code below I have added 19.8 to the y-axis index to move the annotation above the bar.

**Answer: Question 2: Explanation of the Visualization**

**Summary of the Visualization:** 

- Colorado's dominant run-friendliness is revealed across 2010 and 2021 seasons
- Coors Field consistently leads all MLB stadiums in average runs per game, which confirms the altitude advantage makes it the most hitter-friendly ballpark in baseball
- Visualization ranks every stadium by total runs, showing the entire league's spectrum, which extends from highest-scoring environments (Colorado) to most pitcher-friendly parks
- By tracking both years, we can identify which teams’ home parks rank closest to Colorado (high-run environments) versus those furthest away (low-run, pitcher-friendly parks).
- The gap between Colorado and league average reveals the magnitude of Coors Field’s scoring advantage, while the overall distribution shows how teams are distributed across the scoring spectrum
- This comparison across 2010 vs 2021 helps reveal era effects, rule changes, and competitive balance shifts that impact league-wide run rates over time.

**Notable Stadium Comparisons:**

- **Camden Yards (Orioles):** 
  - Known as one of baseball's most influential modern ballparks
  - Typically ranks near the middle of the run-friendliness spectrum
  - Dimensions and design create relatively neutral environment for scoring
  - Interesting benchmark to evaluate whether Colorado is truly exceptional vs. simply above-average

- **Fenway Park (Red Sox):** 
  - One of baseball's most iconic venues
  - Unusual dimensions and Green Monster create unique scoring profile
  - Located near bottom of run-friendliness rankings (pitcher-friendly park)
  - Provides sharp contrast to Colorado's high-run environment
  - Illustrates dramatic range of scoring environments across MLB stadiums

**Does AI come to the right conclusion?** 

Initially, the AI explained about plot and more of technical plot explantion than games and stadium aspects, but after a few iterations, the AI correctly identifies Colorado as one of the most run-friendly ballparks in MLB and provides a clear explanation of the visualization.
AI initially did not come to the right conclusion because it did not understand the data and the visualization.


## Student Analysis Section: Mastering Object-Oriented Matplotlib {#student-analysis-section}

**Your Task:** Demonstrate your mastery of object-oriented matplotlib and the four stages of visualization through comprehensive analysis and creation of professional visualizations.

### Core Challenge: Four Stages Analysis

**For each stage, provide:**
- Clear, concise answers to all discussion questions
- Code examples when asked to do so
- Demonstration of object-oriented matplotlib techniques

### Professional Visualizations (For 100% Grade)

**Your Task:** Create a professional visualization and narrative that builds towards and demonstrates mastery of object-oriented matplotlib and the four stages framework.

**Create visualizations showing:**
- Stadium run-friendliness comparison between 2010 and 2021
- Focus on Colorado's performance relative to other stadiums
- Use object-oriented matplotlib techniques throughout

**Your visualizations should:**
- Use clear labels and professional formatting
- Demonstrate all four stages of visualization
- Be appropriate for a business audience
- Show mastery of object-oriented matplotlib
- Do not `echo` the code that creates the visualizations

## 💾 Important: Save Your Work Frequently!

**Before you start:** Make sure to commit your work often using the Source Control panel in Cursor (Ctrl+Shift+G or Cmd+Shift+G). This prevents the AI from overwriting your progress and ensures you don't lose your work.

**Commit after each major step:**
- After completing each stage section
- After adding your visualizations
- After completing your advanced object-oriented techniques
- Before asking the AI for help with new code

**How to commit:**
1. Open Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G)
2. Stage your changes (+ button)
3. Write a descriptive commit message
4. Click the checkmark to commit

*Remember: Frequent commits are your safety net!*
